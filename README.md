# Arsenic

Arsenic is a language designed as an alternative to TypeScript, stricter and more rigorous, it will transpile towards JS by offering code that is much easier to maintain. It will correct all the little imperfections of TypeScript.

It will try also to add new "false" feature to JavaScript like operator overloading or defer.
